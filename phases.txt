## ✅ Chess Game Project Roadmap (React + Spring Boot)

---

### 🧩 PHASE 1 – Project Setup

**🔹 Goal:** Get a working fullstack skeleton (React frontend + Spring Boot backend)

#### ✅ Checkpoints:

1. Set up a **Spring Boot app**

   * Create with Spring Initializr
   * Add dependencies: `Spring Web`, `Spring DevTools`, `Lombok`, `Spring Boot Test`
   * Set up REST controller: `GET /ping → "pong"`
2. Set up **React frontend**

   * Scaffold with Vite or Create React App
   * Create simple page: `fetch('/ping') → display response`

✔️ **Checkpoint 1 Complete:** You have fullstack communication working (`React → Spring Boot → React`).

---

### ♟ PHASE 2 – Chessboard UI

**🔹 Goal:** Build the chessboard and piece interaction in the frontend.

#### ✅ Checkpoints:

1. Add a chessboard UI library (suggested: [`chessboardjsx`](https://github.com/willb335/chessboardjsx) or make your own board with HTML/CSS)
2. Track board state in React using `chess.js` library
3. Enable dragging/dropping pieces and updating local state

✔️ **Checkpoint 2 Complete:** You can play chess on the frontend (no backend logic yet).

---

### ⚙️ PHASE 3 – Move Logic (Backend)

**🔹 Goal:** Move validation and game state controlled by backend (Spring Boot)

#### ✅ Checkpoints:

1. Create a `Game` Java class that holds:

   * Current board state (e.g., FEN or 2D array)
   * Whose turn it is
   * Game ID
2. Implement REST endpoints:

   * `POST /game` → start new game, return ID
   * `POST /game/{id}/move` → validate + apply move
   * `GET /game/{id}` → get current board state

> 💡 For move validation, either:
>
> * Use Java chess logic library (e.g. [`Chesspresso`](https://github.com/smrtsystems/chesspresso) or [`Chess4j`](https://github.com/jsilva-pt/chess4j)), **or**
> * Let the frontend validate moves with `chess.js` (less secure but easier)

✔️ **Checkpoint 3 Complete:** Your backend now controls the game logic and handles moves.

---

### 🧪 PHASE 4 – Testing & Polishing

**🔹 Goal:** Make sure things work and are bug-free.

#### ✅ Checkpoints:

1. Add unit tests for move logic
2. Ensure illegal moves are rejected
3. Handle edge cases (checkmate, stalemate, promotion, castling)
4. Add resign and restart functionality

✔️ **Checkpoint 4 Complete:** Fully functional chess engine + UI.

---

### 🚀 PHASE 5 – Advanced Features (Optional)

**🔹 Goal:** Add cool extras that make it impressive.

#### 🧠 Ideas:

* Multiplayer matchmaking (Spring WebSocket + STOMP)
* Login/authentication (Spring Security + JWT)
* Persistent games with PostgreSQL (Spring Data JPA)
* AI opponent (connect to Stockfish or write your own)
* Deploy to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk or EC2

### 📥 Resources

* ♟ [`chess.js`](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) (move logic on frontend, easy to start)
* 🧱 [`chessboardjsx`](https://github.com/willb335/chessboardjsx) (React board UI)
* ☁️ [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
* 🐳 Dockerize it later to run anywhere
